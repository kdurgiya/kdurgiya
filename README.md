- 👋 Hola fellow techie, @kdurgiya this side
- 👀 I’m interested in doing coding with logical implementation, primarily in Java however can take any language as I believe once the base is strong, the language is only syntax :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Spring boot concepts, WebSockets, Kubernetes, AWS, React/Angular, etc myriad of technologies
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Java specific work, or even other things as I'm always open to learning new things, and provide my input as a value addition
- 📫 I can be reached out at kdurgiya@gmail.com , drop a line for collaboration, or any tech related stuff and I will be happy to communicate via same channel, cheers!
